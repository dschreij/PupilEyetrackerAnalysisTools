# Pupil Eyetracker Analysis Tools

Python library for analyzing data from the pupil eyetracker. This is currently a WIP but should already offer some useful functions, among which:

- Plot fixations
- Create heatmaps
- Assign interest area's and determine in which IA a fixation fell.
- Create scanpath ratios

Documentation is available in the source, but I will create some sphinx documentation soon.

You can use this module by installing it with

~~~
python setup.py install
~~~
and importing it with
~~~
import pupiltools
~~~
